# Your First Computer

Congratulations, and welcome to Dan's guide to owning your first computer!

You're probably already pretty excited to own something as cool as a computer, but remember, as Spider-Man's uncle said:

![With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility](http://iconic-inc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/il_570xN.347082039.jpg)

A computer is maybe the most powerful invention the human race has ever conceived.  What other object will allow you to communicate with, and even control, other objects all over the world, in a coordinated, pre-programmed way?

With all that power, you'd better believe there are certain responsibilities, and even *dangers* to be aware of!

It's hard to be responsible with all that power, when computers seem so mysterious and hard to understand!  That's why a responsible computer user does their best to learn what a computer really *is*.

Let's hear from Lady Ada Lovelace, one of the first people to understand what a thinking machine would be! She and her friend Charles Babbage called their idea "The Analytical Engine", and she wrote about it in 1842:

![Lady Ada of Lovelace](https://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/figures/adaphotoc.jpg)

>The Analytical Engine, on the contrary, is not merely adapted for tabulating the results of one particular function and of no other, but for developing and tabulating any function whatever. In fact the engine may be described as being the material expression of any indefinite function of any degree of generality and complexity

So while other machines before could add up numbers, or even do math on them, a computer, or "Analytical Engine", can be programmed to perform any function at all!

Since you've played with [http://scratch.mit.edu](Scratch), you know all about how fun it is to program a computer to do what you want.  But since a computer can be programmed to do anything, you might wonder, how does it know whose instructions to trust?

## How To Keep Hackers From PWNING You

![Hacker Ninja](http://www.v3.co.uk/IMG/656/198656/hacker1.jpg)

The short answer is that it's very hard to keep a computer secure!

Every time you download a file, or click a link, load a website, connect to a server, or even just leave your computer plugged into the internet, you're giving other people the opportunity to run their instructions on your computer.

The easiest way for someone to run their instructions on your computer is to trick you into running their program. (Duh!)  To prevent that, be careful what programs you run on your computer!  Even some documents can be "infected", and so you should be careful about anything you download and open!

The next easiest way for someone to run their instructions on your computer is if they can get your password, and connect to your computer over the internet.  

The easiest way to get your password is to guess it, but that only works if your password is really short!

To experiment with how long of a password is safe, try using [How Safe Is My Password](https://howsecureismypassword.net/), a fun website to play with security.

The next easiest way to get your password is if you use the same password in a lot of different places.

For example, if you use your main password on *SuperFunGamez.com*, and then *SuperFunGamez.com* gets their hard drive stolen, and they were storing your password in *plain text*, that hacker now has your password.  That's why it's always a good idea to use different passwords on different sites.

Lastly, the real serious hackers will try to exploit vulnerabilities on servers you might be running.  For example, if you run a Minecraft server, and you keep that port open to the public, just be aware, that's one more port a hacker can try to `PWN` you on.

Obviously I'm not saying you shouldn't run servers.  The whole internet is built on servers.  But just remember:  Every service is a vulnerability waiting to happen.

## Being a Good Netizen

Citizens of the Internet, Unite!

>"There's only one rule that I know of, babiesâ€”God damn it, you've got to be kind." - Kurt Vonnegut

First off, be nice to people!  Cyber-bullying is a real thing, and kids (yourself included) can be very upset by cruel behavior online.  So don't give in to your darker nature, and be nice to people online!

If people are mean to you online, just remember they're probably feeling hurt themselves, and as long as you don't give them any identifying information, you should be fine.

### Identifying Yourself

While you're a kid, a good rule of thumb is *never identify yourself online without your parent's permission*.  There are a lot of crazy people online, and lots of them are willing to pretend to be someone they're not to gain your trust.  Being chat buddies may be fine, but before you ever consider letting someone know who you really are, make sure your parents feel it's safe.

### Laws to Follow

There are two major kinds of laws that people break online.  One kind (pirating music, movies, and applications) where companies might try to sue you, and one kind where you can be sent to prison for years.  Let's talk about that prison one.

#### The DMCA

Right now in the United States we live under a law called [The DMCA (Digital Millenium Copyright Act)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act).

When it was written, this law was meant to keep people from pirating stuff, but the law was written in a way where you can be sent to prison if you use a site in a way *other than it was intended*.

The problem with that is *who gets to say how a site was intended to be used?*  You might come up with a clever way to cheat at a game, and that site owner could argue that you violated the `DMCA`.

That's why I don't recommend you try to go hacking people's websites until you know how to do it in a safe and legal way.  In fact these days, even hackers who are trying to do it in a legal way are very careful about what they admit to having done, since the law is so open-ended.

## Encryption

I said before that anything you send over the internet could be looked at by other people.  This is true *unless* you use `encryption`.

Encryption is incredibly cool, but is probably beyond the scope of this lesson, but I recommend you learn about `Public Key Encryption` as soon as you're ready.

There are some sites on the web even for teaching kids about public key encryption.

[This site](http://csunplugged.org/public-key-encryption) has a video where kids explain it.  That could be fun!

## That's it for now!

Those are the things I think are the most important to know about before you own your own computer.

Computers are very powerful, and if you learn to use them well, you'll be able to do things that you only dreamed of.  But if you abuse them, you can get your money stolen, can be sent to prison, or can reveal yourself to dangerous people.

Remember the internet is a real place, and it's full of people you can't just go around trusting.

Beyond that, go have fun, you've got the world's knowledge at your fingertips, and whenever you have a question, you only need to [Google](http://google.com) it.
